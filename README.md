# Songs-Recommender


##Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/18adykNGhHU) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval. We're going to be looking at recommendation systems and we focus on popularity-based, item-item collaborative filtering, and user-item collaborative filtering. Then at the end we talk about the bleeding edge, which is a deep learning approach. 


##Dependencies

* pandas
* scikit-learn
* numpy
* scipy

Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install missing dependencies. 


##Usage

Run `jupyter notebook` when in the main code directory to see this run in your browser.

##Credits

This project is done entirely by [llSourcell](https://github.com/llSourcell) I've just tried implementing it to learn how different recommender techniques works.
Credits go to [dvysardana](https://github.com/dvysardana). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
